        Carbon NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are emerging as a promising solution for mitigating the negative impacts of carbon emissions on the environment. They represent a digital asset that tracks the carbon footprint of a specific product or service, allowing companies and consumers to take more informed and responsible decisions regarding their carbon footprint. The use of AI in carbon NFTs can significantly enhance their accuracy, transparency, and efficiency.

        <p> Consider the carbons that are emitted just to get fuel into the tank: From the energy needed to extract the oil from underground, the pollution caused by transportation and refinement, to the final delivery to your local petrol station. Not to mention the Co2 released by manufacturing your car in the first place.</p>
