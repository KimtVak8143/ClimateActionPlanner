00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.330
the simple show explains the carbon

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.490
footprint this is you you've probably

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.260
been hearing a lot about climate change

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.090
and how you should reduce your carbon

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.490
footprint but what is that exactly just

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.160
like an actual footprint it's a mark you

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.070
leave upon the environment help not with

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.260
your shoes but with every action that

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.529
releases carbons those are the harmful

10
00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.070
gases such as co2 which are pumped out

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.559
by burning fossil fuels like oil or gas

12
00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.370
the more fuel you use the bigger your

13
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.370
footprint will be you may think that by

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.620
driving your car the only carbon you

15
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.860
release come from the engine but no

16
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.120
consider the carbons that are emitted

17
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.760
just to get fuel into the tank from the

18
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.800
energy needed to extract the oil from

19
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.230
underground the pollution caused by

20
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.809
transportation and refinement to the

21
00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.120
final delivery to your local petrol

22
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.300
station not to mention the co2 released

23
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.430
by manufacturing your car in the first

24
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.270
place more than your thought so unless

25
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.790
you live in a cave you and everything

26
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.110
you own has its own carbon footprint

27
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.170
read a book printing and distributing it

28
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.380
uses energy brush your teeth and your

29
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.420
utensils will have a history in a

30
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.540
factory even something as basic as an

31
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.970
apple could have travelled hundreds or

32
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.850
even thousands of colluding miles to end

33
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.520
up in your local supermarket you see

34
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.799
it's pretty much impossible to leave no

35
00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.200
carbon footprint behind but that's no

36
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.079
reason to stop trying think about your

37
00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.750
actions and choices and you'll be able

38
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.409
to reduce your personal mark after all

39
00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.659
that's how you really put the boot in to

40
00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.470
climate change

41
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.979
you
